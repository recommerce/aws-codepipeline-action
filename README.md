## GitHub Actions x AWS CodePipeline

This GitHub Actions will help you trigger a pipeline in your AWS CodePipeline - assumming you already have the pipeline. This will not create the pipeline for you.

## Setup

### AWS IAM

Create an IAM user with `codepipeline:StartPipelineExecution` permission. You may take and customize the IAM policy below as starter point. Note that I'm using `"*"` in the policy. For better security, you can limit the policy to only execute specific pipelines. You can read more about IAM for CodePipeline [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/permissions-reference.html).

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "codepipeline:StartPipelineExecution"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### GitHub Secrets

After you create the IAM user with the right permission, add two variables below in your GitHub repository secrets area:

- `AWS_PIPELINE_ACCESS_KEY`: the Access Key ID for the user that you just created
- `AWS_PIPELINE_SECRET_KEY`: the Secret Key for the user that you just created

## Usage

### Basic Usage

**Note**:

- Please check the latest available version [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aws-codepipeline-trigger) and replace it with `X.X.X` in the code examples below.

- Identify in which AWS region your pipeline is located. Use that region name for `aws-region` key below. AWS regions list is available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints).

```
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Trigger AWS CodePipeline
        uses: zulhfreelancer/aws-codepipeline-action@vX.X.X
        with:
          aws-region: "ap-southeast-1"
          aws-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_SECRET_KEY }}
          pipeline-name: "your-pipeline-name"
```

### Advance Usage

Below is the example for situation where:

- You only want to trigger the pipeline if previous job was successful
- You only want to trigger the pipeline if the Git branch that GitHub Actions currently running is a specific branch

```
jobs:
  job1:
    ... code for job1 ...
  deploy:
    needs: job1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Trigger AWS CodePipeline
        uses: zulhfreelancer/aws-codepipeline-action@vX.X.X
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/your-branch-name'
        with:
          aws-region: "ap-southeast-1"
          aws-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_SECRET_KEY }}
          pipeline-name: "your-pipeline-name"
```

## Optional - Fail the workflow if CodePipeline call returns an error
By default, only a log message is displayed if Codepipeline call returns an error, but the workflow is not marked as failed.

By setting the input `fail-on-error` to `true` (`True` or `TRUE` are also accepted), the Github workflow will be marked as failed, and will interrupt the workflow run.

## Get the CodePipelineExcutionId
```
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Trigger AWS CodePipeline
        id: aws-codepipeline
        uses: zulhfreelancer/aws-codepipeline-action@vX.X.X
        with:
          aws-region: "ap-southeast-1"
          aws-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_SECRET_KEY }}
          pipeline-name: "your-pipeline-name"

      - name: Get the CodePipelineExecutionId
        run: echo "CodePipelineExecutionId is ${{ steps.aws-codepipeline.outputs.codepipeline-execution-id }}"
```

```
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Trigger AWS CodePipeline
        uses: zulhfreelancer/aws-codepipeline-action@vX.X.X
        with:
          aws-region: "ap-southeast-1"
          aws-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-secret-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_PIPELINE_SECRET_KEY }}
          pipeline-name: "your-pipeline-name"
          fail-on-error: "true"
```
